The efficacy of the quality assurance process relies heavily on the tester's comprehension that tests yielding no identified bugs, despite being labeled successful, have essentially failed to detect potential defects within the software build. Crafting a meticulous test plan emerges as a pivotal phase, akin to understanding an adversary and devising strategies for overcoming challenges. In this context, access to documents integral to the development of software functionalities becomes imperative.
In the case of the Luma E-commerce platform, the absence of a formal business requirement document necessitated a reliance on traditional tester intuition. I meticulously articulated the intended functionalities, mapping out critical pathways for the platform based on a comprehensive understanding of the software elements. the entire test plan can be accessed through this Google link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11y8IQ0NeJSY7gzoh6UruZhf1Cj0n0Jbkm-3djOqnfLc/edit?usp=sharing

To manage the automation process successfully, the testing tools used for the process must be streamlined. For this project, I used the following tools to accomplish a smooth automated process. Python, Pytest, Selenium, Google Sheets, browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer), HTML, CSS, Jenkins (for continuous development and integration), and GitHub (for version control). 
Automation, at its core, minimizes human involvement in task execution, particularly enhancing efficiency in agile development. In this project, I categorized tests into automated and manual, optimizing regression testing speed and freeing up testers for other essential development tasks.
